# MY PROJECTS
## DESCRIPTION
These are some of the projects I have done as I learn ICs.

## REQUIREMENTS
For most part of these projects you will require the following:
1. An ESP8266 [esp-12e](https://store.nerokas.co.ke/2637) - This is my primary IC unless where I stated otherwise.
2. 2 or more [Breadboards](https://www.jumia.co.ke/915-generation-breadboard-experiment-board-breadboard-400-128121718.html)
3. Atleast 5 [Jumperwires](https://www.jumia.co.ke/catalog/?q=jumper+wires) of each type i.e male to male, female to female, male to female.
4. A type B [USB cable](https://www.jumia.co.ke/android-usb-cable-black-oraimo-mpg217933.html).

Keep in mind specific projects will have specific requirements!

This will be documented inside those project folders.

For software you'll need:
1. [Vs-code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) IDE.
2. Download the plartformio from the vs code extensions.
3. Learn plartformio and Vs code from [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/vs-code-platformio-ide-esp32-esp8266-arduino/).
4. GCC compiler.

## BUILD
The specific projects will have the main file in which will include the code for that specific project. This will however also be documented in those specific files.

Make sure you learn how to use platformio to know how the basics of uploading code to your Esp.
